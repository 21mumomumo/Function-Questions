# Temperature Converter

A sleek and intuitive web-based temperature converter that transforms a simple JavaScript coding challenge into a practical, user-friendly application.

## Practice Overview

This practice exercise evolved from a JavaScript coding challenge focused on creating a one-line arrow function. What started as a simple temperature conversion function was enhanced into a functional web application, demonstrating how basic programming concepts can be expanded into practical, user-facing solutions.

### Core Features

- **One-Line Temperature Conversion**: Implements an elegant arrow function for F to Â°C conversion
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Clean, responsive design for easy temperature input and conversion
- **Real-Time Results**: Instant conversion with formatted output
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design that works across all device sizes

## Technical Implementation

### The Core Challenge
The original challenge required creating a concise Fahrenheit to Celsius converter:
